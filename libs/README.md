# Library Subdirectory

All libraries developed for the project will be here.

As this is structured like a subdirectory, you could create a build folder here and build the libraries alone. 

Though [CppLinuxSerial](https://github.com/gbmhunter/CppLinuxSerial) will still need to be installed, as it is a dependency for all libraries.


## Tesla Meter Remarks

Will add a guide here to get the Teslameter to show up as a com port below soon.
